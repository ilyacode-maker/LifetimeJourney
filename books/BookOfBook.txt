He had begun to read the novel a few days before. He had put it aside because of some urgent business, opened it again on his way 
back to the estate by train; he allowed himself a slowly growing interest in the plot, in the drawing of characters. 
That afternoon, after writing a letter to his agent and discussing with the manager of his estate a matter of joint ownership, 
he returned to the book in the tranquility of his study which looked out upon the park with its oaks. Sprawled in his favorite 
armchair, with his back to the door, which would otherwise have bothered him as an irritating possibility for intrusions, 
he let his left hand caress once and again the green velvet upholstery and set to reading the final chapters. Without effort 
his memory retained the names and images of the protagonists; the illusion took hold of him almost at once. He tasted the 
almost perverse pleasure of disengaging himself line by line from all that surrounded him, and feeling at the same time that 
his head was relaxing comfortably against the green velvet of the armchair with its high back, that the cigarettes were still 
within reach of his hand.that beyond the great windows the afternoon air danced under the oak trees in the park. Word by word, 
immersed in the sordid dilemma of the hero and heroine, letting himself go toward where the images came together and took on color
and movement, he was witness to the final encounter in the mountain cabin. The woman arrived first, apprehensive; now the lover 
came in, his face cut by the backlash of a branch. Admirably she stanched the blood with her kisses, but he rebuffed her caresses,
he had not come to repeat the ceremonies of a secret passion, protected by a world of dry leaves and furtive paths through the 
forest. The dagger warmed itself against his chest, and underneath pounded liberty, ready to spring. A lustful, yearning dialogue 
raced down the pages like a rivulet of snakes, and one felt it had all been decided from eternity. Even those caresses which 
writhed about the lover's body, as though wishing to keep him there, to dissuade him from it, sketched abominably the figure of 
that other body it was necessary to destroy. Nothing had been forgotten: alibis, unforeseen hazards, possible mistakes. From this hour on, each instant had its use minutely assigned. The cold-blooded, double re-examination of the details was barely interrupted for a hand to caress a cheek. It was beginning to get dark. 
Without looking at each other now, rigidly fixed upon the task which awaited them, they separated at the cabin door. She was 
to follow the trail that led north. On the path leading in the opposite direction, he turned for a moment to watch her running 
with her hair let loose. He ran in turn, crouching among the trees and hedges until he could distinguish in the yellowish fog of 
dusk the avenue of trees leading up to the house. The dogs were not supposed to bark, and they did not bark. The estate manager 
would not be there at this hour, and he was not. He went up the three porch steps and entered. Through the blood galloping in his 
ears came the woman's words: first a blue parlor, then a gallery, then a carpeted stairway. At the top, two doors. No one in the 
first bedroom, no one in the second. The door of the salon, and then the knife in his hand, the light from the great windows, 
the high back of an armchair covered in green velvet, the head of the man in the chair reading a novel.The man reading, adrift upon a river of ink and desire, felt a tremor in the air, a discordant note in the symphony of the everyday. He marked his place in the book with a finger, the green velvet a soothing counterpoint to the prickle on the back of his neck. His mind, still tangled in the web of the story he inhabited, sought for the source of the disturbance. 

Had the light changed? Was there a chill, a premonition of rain in the breeze that stirred the oaks beyond the windowpanes? He listened, but the silence within the house held only the echoes of his own breathing, the faint tick of the grandfather clock in the hall, the phantom rustle of turning pages.

He chided himself for letting the fictional drama seep into the sanctuary of his study. This was his domain, his haven from the clamor of the world.  And yet, the disquiet lingered, a subtle dissonance that refused to be ignored. 

He rose from the armchair, its embrace reluctant to release him. The green velvet, moments ago a source of comfort, now seemed to cling, to whisper of entrapment. He walked to the window, the park spread out before him like a painted tapestry. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows from the oaks, their branches weaving patterns that shifted and danced in the breeze. 

He stood there for a long moment, searching for the source of his unease. It was absurd, he told himself. He was letting a story, a mere construct of words, unsettle him.  And yet, the feeling persisted, a whisper at the edge of his awareness, a premonition of something about to unfold.

Turning from the window, he walked towards the door, drawn by an inexplicable compulsion to confront the unseen disturbance. His hand reached for the knob, hesitant, the polished brass cold beneath his touch. He paused, the silence pressing in on him, thick and heavy with anticipation. 

Then, with a deep breath, he opened the door. 
The hallway stood before him, dappled with the dying light filtering through the stained-glass window at its far end. It was a scene he knew intimately, yet it seemed oddly unfamiliar, as though he were seeing it for the first time. The air, usually filled with the comforting scents of beeswax and old wood, carried a faint, unfamiliar tang. He hesitated, the echo of his heartbeat in his ears like a drumbeat of doubt.

Had he heard something after all? A floorboard creaking under a stealthy footfall, the rustle of silk against the wall? He strained to listen, but the silence held, unbroken save for the grandfather clock in the hall measuring out seconds with its measured cadence.

He stepped into the hallway, closing the study door behind him with a quiet click that seemed to reverberate in the stillness.  His hand instinctively went to the antique walking stick resting against the wall, a familiar weight, reassuringly solid. 

He moved slowly, the runner beneath his feet muting his steps. The air grew cooler as he progressed, the light from the stained-glass window casting multicolored shadows that danced before him like phantoms. He reached the end of the hallway, the air thick with the scent of lilies from the vase beneath the window. 

He paused, peering into the shadowy recesses of the hallway, seeking an explanation for the unease that had seeped into his bones. But there was nothing. He was alone, the silence a shroud, the shadows his only companions. 

He turned back towards his study, a wave of self-reproach washing over him. He was being foolish, letting a story, a mere fabrication of words, weave a spell of unease around him. He reached the door, his hand already reaching for the knob, when a sound, soft as a whisper, stopped him in his tracks. 

It came again, a faint scratching, coming from within the study, from the other side of the door. 
The sound, though faint, was sharp, like a fingernail drawn lightly across fine silk, sending a tremor of unease through him. His heart, a moment ago soothed by the familiar silence of his home, now pounded against his ribs, a frantic bird in a gilded cage. 

He stood, rooted to the spot, his hand hovering inches from the doorknob. It was absurd, irrational, this sudden surge of fear. A draft perhaps, lifting a stray branch against the windowpane. A field mouse, bolder than most, venturing indoors as the evening chill settled.  And yet, the sound had held a quality, a subtle intent, that whispered of something more, somethingâ€¦ calculated. 

The scent of lilies from the stained-glass window seemed to press upon him, cloyingly sweet, laced with a metallic tang he couldn't place. A wave of dizziness swept over him, and for a moment the shadows cast by the dying light seemed to writhe, taking on the shape of grasping hands, grotesque and menacing. 

He shook off the vision, his grip tightening on the walking stick.  He would not be cowed by phantoms of his own making, by echoes of a story he had willingly inhabited. 

He threw open the door, his movement sharp, the walking stick raised high, ready to strike. But the room that greeted him was his own, bathed in the last golden rays of the setting sun, the shadows long and familiar. 

The air hung heavy, still, the scent of pipe tobacco and leather a comforting counterpoint to the cloying sweetness of the lilies.  The fire in the hearth had burned low, embers glowing like the eyes of a watchful beast.  His book lay open on the armchair, a ribbon of crimson marking his place. He could almost feel the smooth velvet beneath his fingertips, the weight of the book, its pages whispering secrets. 

He stepped inside, his gaze sweeping the room, searching every shadowed corner, every recess where an intruder might lurk. But there was nothing.  The scratching sound had vanished, leaving behind only a silence thick with anticipation, like the hush before a storm.
